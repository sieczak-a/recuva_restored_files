# recuva_restored_files
Python script grouping files depending on extension

I used Recuva program to restore files from damaged HHD drive. 
Recuva generated multiple directories where files were stored in pattern:
recup_dir.1
recup_dir.2
.
.
recup_dir.104

Needed to restore only .jpeg files from all directiories.
