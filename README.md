# recuva_restored_files
Python script grouping files depending on extension

I used Recuva program to restore files from damaged HHD drive. 
Recuva generated multiple directories with files. 

Directiories names were created with pattern:
recup_dir.1 ..  recup_dir.2 .. recup_dir.104

Needed to move only .jpeg files from all directiories to one place.
